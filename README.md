# Neural-Networks

The point of this project is to start to delve into a surface level understanding of Neural Networks. 
The code will be heavily adapted from Welsh Labs's series on Neural Networking. However, instead of using the example of
test scores, The MNIST database of handwritten digits will be used. 

This is also my first attempt using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
