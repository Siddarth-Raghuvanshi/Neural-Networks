# Neural-Networks

The point of this project is to start to delve into a surface level understanding of Neural Networks. 


Welsh Lab's code will be copied initially in order to understand both Python and Neural Networks. 

After that, I will adapt the code to recognize handwriten digits.The MNIST database of handwritten digits will be used. 

This is also my first attempt using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 

You should check out Welsh Lab's, he does a great job at explaining this content in an indepth but understandable manner.
